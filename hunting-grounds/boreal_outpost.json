    "description": "When separated from its other half, Boreal Outpost drifts alone through the skies. Its Behemoths-some cast out from Coldrunner Key-are castaways vying for what little land they can. Foolish cargo haulers once sought refuge on this island when it meandered through trade routes, but soon found their ships under siege from desperate fauna.
