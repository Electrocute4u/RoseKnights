The Krolachi explorers who first charted it found that massive weather formations spun out from what they called \"Mother Storm\" - and then linger here, feeding on shock aether until they become mini-Maelstroms in their own right.",

A similar skull can be found in Ramsgate itself. Despite its size, it must have been an ordinary animal. Dead Behemoths don't leave skulls behind."

Every smith worth their anvil has spent at least a few evenings at the Broken Blade sharing theories with fellow smiths about the furnaces' whereabouts and whether they'd still work for their intended purpose: forging legendary weapons and armour using trophies from the relentless Charrogg, patron Behemoth of the Krolach Archipelago. Most reliable sources claim at least two working furnaces still exist in the isles, but no dedicated effort has been made to find and retrieve them."
