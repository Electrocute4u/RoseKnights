Some freelance treasure hunters who discovered a few Unseen relics there have hypothesized the cultists had some influence on the island's lethal equilibrium of frost and umbral, but the official Orrery position is that this kind of power is far beyond a \"mere cult\". Both Arkan Drew and Dr. Priyani have warned their superiors that this is short-sighted.",
