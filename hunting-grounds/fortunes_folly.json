A frequent waystation (more of a \"hitching post\", was how Bosun Markus described it) of convenience for corsairs looking to lay low within the dangerous cover of its rainstorms and fog banks, the ironically named isle has seen far less use of late, ever since another wave of Behemoths arrived to feed on newly exposed archonite deposits.",
